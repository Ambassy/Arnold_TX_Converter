# Arnold TX Converter

**Arnold TX Converter** is a lightweight, PySide6-based GUI tool designed to streamline texture conversion for Arnold rendering. It wraps the `maketx` command-line utility and adds convenience features to optimize your workflow. This project was developed with the help of **ChatGPT**.

## Features

* **Arnold-focused**: Specifically designed as a `maketx` wrapper for Arnold textures.
* **OCIO Support**: Select a custom `.ocio` file in the GUI, or fallback to your `$OCIO` environment setting.
* **maketx Path Management**: Choose `maketx.exe` once, and the path is remembered in `~/.arnold_tx_converter.json`.
* **Concurrency**: Uses up to `(CPU cores - 1)` parallel `maketx` processes for faster conversions.
* **Automatic Output**: Converted `.tx` files are saved next to their source textures.
* **Skip Existing Files**: Skips conversion if a `.tx` already exists and is newer than the source texture.
* **Logging**: In-GUI logging with optional external log file for full tracking.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arnold_tx_converter.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the GUI:

   ```bash
   python txconvert_gui.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the GUI.
2. Select your `maketx` executable and optional OCIO configuration.
3. Add your textures and start the conversion process.
4. Check the log in the UI or external log file for progress and errors.
